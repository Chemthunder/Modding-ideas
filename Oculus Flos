# Blocks / Mechanics

# Rotting Eyeblossom
Created upon killing a player (an entity in testing) that spreads Flos Vitis and damages nearby entities / giving them the Repulsed effect.

# Flos Vitis
A sort of purple vine that grows out of Rotting Eyeblossoms and the Infected upon reaching later stages. Damages any entity who steps on it unless they have Oculitis or are in Creative.


# Oculitis (My version)
Application is the effect / component, triggered via inventoryTick of having the Oculus Flos in your inventory (Is it Oculus or Oculos?) 

## Stage One (Hear no Evil)
The user begins to smell like flowers, emitting flower particles that spawn around the player or whenever they hit something. The user begins to grow distant from friends / loved ones and begins to lose themself.

Not contagious.
Does not spread.

## Stage Two (Isolation)
The user begins to have flower growths over their legs and hands, and can speak to plants. Users become more and more attached to Oculus Flos. Places the user frequent begin to bloom with Flos Vitis.

Semi-contagious.
Does not spread.

## Stage Three (Absolvement)
The user has flower growths all over their body, and spends most of their time indoors / away from others. Users never let Oculus Flos out of their sight for more than thirty seconds. Places the user lives in erupt with Rotting Eyeblossoms. Entities the user kills will spread Flos Vitis.

Contagious.
Spreads.

## Stage Four (In Nihilum Dissolvere)
The user is completely covered in flowers, which have now “bloomed”, opening their eyes. Oculus Flos is now inseparable from the Infected. 

Contagious
Spreads

Cannot be trusted.
Wildcard.
